# Arduino-Mass-Based-Espresso
This project uses the PID controller for temperature control. 
It has added functions:
	-It measures the mass of extracted espresso to calculate the extraction ratio of the espresso
	-It uses a RTC to turn on and off automagically
	-It uses Rancilio Switches as inputs to microcontrollers
	-It breaks up the work across multiple microcontrollers, 
		sending data back to the central microcontroller
