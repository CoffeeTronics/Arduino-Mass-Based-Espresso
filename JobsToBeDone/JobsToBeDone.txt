TO BE COMPLETED
RTC set preheat and turnoff times/days in Menu 
RTC read Vcc rails periodically (1hr?) to ensure minimal drift.
Menu - add MenuItem change set point (brew and steam)
Menu - add MenuItem change temp scale (C and F)
Menu - add MenuItem manual tune values (P,I,D)
Menu - add MenuItem change preinfuson and brew pump characteristics
Menu - add ability to read Vcc rails for ADC
Menu - add ability to change number of ADC readings for digitalSmooth


Brew switch on - starts preinfusion, turns on heater, tares scale, starts shot timer
Brew switch off - turns off pump, switch heater control back to PID loop, displays shot time and shot mass, 
        stores last 5(?) shot times, coffee grinds and shot masses in linked list
Steam switch on - change to steam setpoint
Steam switch off - change back to brew setpoint

Swap out boiler SSR for roll-your-own SSR (MOC3042 and BTA06)

EEPROM - save all parameters in case of power off

Swap DS1307 for DS3231 (Samples currently being shipped)

PROBLEMS TO BE FIXED

Vcc to ADC seems to drift about 0.3V, causing errors in temp readings - adjust code so that it measures Vcc periodically 

Master I2C  	- Temp reading correctly
		- Output reading correctly
		- Extraction complete reading correctly (although some delay)
		- Switch state NOT reading correctly

Slave Brew control - some erroneous readings on brew switch state. Currently solved in software, need to fix in hardware
