TO BE COMPLETED
RTC set preheat and turnoff times/days in Menu 
RTC read Vcc rails periodically (1hr?) to ensure minimal drift.
Menu - add MenuItem change set point (brew and steam)
Menu - add MenuItem change temp scale (C and F)
Menu - add MenuItem manual tune values (P,I,D)
Menu - add MenuItem change preinfuson and brew pump characteristics
Menu - add ability to read Vcc rails for ADC
Menu - add ability to change number of ADC readings for digitalSmooth

Use Silvia front switches as uC inputs using PS2505
    Brew switch on - starts preinfusion, turns on heater, tares scale, starts shot timer
    Brew switch off - turns off pump, switch heater control back to PID loop, displays shot time and shot mass, 
        stores last 5(?) shot times, coffee grinds and shot masses in linked list
    Steam switch on - change to steam setpoint
    Steam switch off - change back to brew setpoint

PROBLEMS TO BE FIXED

Vcc to ADC seems to drift about 0.3V, causing errors in temp readings  
               
Switching pump and off using 5V. When active wire only is switched,
	there is an e humming electrical humming coming from the pump.	FIXED
	Tried using a triac with no success.
